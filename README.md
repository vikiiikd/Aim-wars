# Aim wars

Aim wars is a lightweight, two-player reaction game built in Python, designed to test accuracy, timing, and just a little bit of friendly competition. Each round, a colorful target appears with a green dot placed at a random location. Players take turns and have 3 seconds to click as close to the dot as possible; the closer the click lands, the more points are earned, up to a maximum of 100 per turn. After three rounds, the player with the highest score wins, and if there’s a tie, total reaction time decides the final outcome. The game uses a simple graphics library and incorporates geometry-based scoring by calculating the distance between the click and the target dot, along with a clean draw/undraw loop to keep the interface responsive. This project was a collaborative effort created with my sister, and it became a fun way to blend logic, visual feedback, and game mechanics while learning how to structure interactive Python programs. Beyond coding, the project highlighted how math can be translated directly into gameplay and how small helper functions can make larger programs easier to manage and extend. Dot Duel is quick to play, easy to understand, and designed to be enjoyed in short bursts—perfect for testing reflexes, comparing scores, and occasionally settling sibling bragging rights. The full source code is available here on GitHub for anyone who wants to try it out, modify it, or use it as inspiration for their own simple game experiments.
