# Aim-wars
Dot Duel is a simple 2-player Python game where a green dot appears on a target and each player has 3 seconds to click as close as possible. The points are based on accuracy, and the fastest player breaks ties. I created this mini game with my sister as a fun way to mix math, timing, and friendly competition.
